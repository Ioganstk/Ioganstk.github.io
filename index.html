<p> Throughout the whole process, we had many ideas. At first we decided to reinvent a backpack and blanket. After many ideas, we finally decided on making a water bottle that is able to heat drinks on the go. </p>
</div>
<div class = "scbyellow">2
<p> We settled on our idea by deciding what products we might like to be created or reinvented. We went through the first few ideas and picked out flaws in them and found what was already made. Through this process, we came up with our current product that we sell today. </p>
</div>
<div class = "scbyellow">3
<p> We believe that this product is an excelent addition to the water bottle industry. If we were able to choose another idea, we might have made an alarm clock that can help someone wake up, by forcing them to move around to stop it from making noise and flashing. </p><br>
