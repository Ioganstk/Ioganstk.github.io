<p> Throughout the whole process, we had many ideas. At first we decided to reinvent a backpack and blankt. After many ideas, we finally decided on making a water bottle that is able to heat drinks on the go. </p>
</div>
<div class = "scbyellow">2
<p> We settled on our idea by deciding what products we might like to be created or reinvented. We went through the first few ideas and picked out flaws in them and found what was already made. Through this process, we came up with our current product that we sell today. </p>
</div>
<div class = "scbyellow">3
<p> We believe that this product is an excelent addition to the water bottle industry. If we were able to choose another idea, we might have made an alarm clock that can help someone wake up, by forcing them to move around to stop it from making noise and flashing. </p><br>

        <h3> <div> We are HydroHeat and our product is the HydroHeat multipurpose water bottle. Our product is aimed at teens but with its easy design, 
            it allows anyone to use it. Our product is useful in many different ways by allowing you to change the temperature of your drinks, track 
            how much you drink, and keep them at the same temperature. Our product’s long battery life allows it to be used every day and the temperature 
            control allows it to be used any time of the year. As a water bottle, all you need to do is fill it with any liquid of your choosing, close 
            the lid, and sip away. Even if we hadn't created this product, we all would at least consider purchasing the water bottle. Our product is 
            designed for daily use with its temperature control being its most important feature. While other products only allow the maintaining of a 
            liquid's temperature or the tracking of its intake, our product allows you to be in control. With our heating system, you can change the 
            temperature of the liquid inside while the double-layered titanium case retains the temperature of the liquid. While designing our product 
            we were aiming to solve the issue of teens' drinks going warm or cold over long periods of time. Our product is meant to be affordable for 
            the components used and most cost-effective. </div></h3>
